There were two main deliverables I was seeking with this project. First, I wanted to continue developing my ETL skills within SQL. Once I completed this, I actually denormalized the dataset to ready a CSV file, so I could use it for working with R (in RStudio). This was the second deliverable for this project.

This project involved an extra step before normalizing the data. That step was to concatenate the tables for each individual manufacturer (after both adding a column and inserting the manufacturer name into that column).

It was enjoyable. I learned many ways to improve the performance of the ETL work along the way that I can apply to other projects in the future.
